 * TODO: @todo Manage threads when using cocoa (create at least one NSTask and 
 *             create an autoreleasepool inside the threads.
 * TODO: @todo Add docs to say how many threads can run at max and if joined 
 *             thread slots are recycled or are blocked for the runtime of the 
 *             app. Decide if the id is really necessary.
 * TODO: @todo Decide, implement, and document if amp threads surpress 
 *             signals from reaching them.
