 * Shallow wrapper around Pthreads threads implements all backend specific 
 * (non-common) functions from amp_thread.h, amp_raw_thread.h, and 
 * amp_internal_thread.h.
 *
 * TODO: @todo Decide if to use Pthreads yield instead of POSIX yield.
 *
 * TODO: @todo Remove thread id hack using pthread_t and replace with a proper
 *             thread id implementation. Also look into the next C standard
 *             and the next C++ standard to get an idea how to refactor the
 *             whole id thematic. Idea: use a thread local slot that points
 *             to the threads amp struct and use that address as the id value.
 *             The main thread is represented by NULL and accessing the amp
 *             thread id on non-amp-thread-created threads is undefined 
 *             behavior. Or let one thread point to the other to organize
 *             truly unique numbers as ids though this will lead to O(n) 
 *             complexity.
